Discussion of design for a multisocket game lobby

1. Server maintains an array of active game sessions
    a. each active game maintains an array of Websocket connections for the various clients
    b. If a client disconnects, we can hold onto their information for a set time to allow them
       to reconnect to their game if needed
2. when a client loads the lobby they get a list of all available servers to connect to
    a. when they select a server, the webserver will initialize a websocket for them and 
       add them to the array of connections for that lobby
